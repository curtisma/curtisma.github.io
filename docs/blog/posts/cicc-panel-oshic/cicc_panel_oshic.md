## Position Statement

Open-source PDKs, tools, and designs are making IC design accessible to a much larger community of engineers and will find their place in the future.  This will continue to open up IC design education and research with new opportunities to collaboratively build hands-on projects that can be easily reproduced.  It will also open up new opportunities for industrial teams to collaborate with others outside their organization. This will enable new methodologies, techniques, and applications that most organizations aren’t able to evaluate or support on their own. However, for this to reach its full potential we’ll need to adopt new ways to support a healthy community.

Jaeduk Han, Hanyang University, South Korea

 

Bio: Jaeduk Han is an Assistant Professor of Electronic Engineering at Hanyang University. He received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California at Berkeley in 2017. His research interests include high-speed analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuit design and automation.

 

Position Statement: The open-source domain notably empowers Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and solid-state device researchers to more easily construct circuits. Moreover, open-source hardware shines in facilitating design reusability and collaboration, as evidenced by our research team’s work on integrating automated layout tools with synthesis-based memory compilers, which is difficult to achieve in closed domains. Nonetheless, for open-source hardware technology to advance, several challenges must be overcome. For instance, in hardware design, synthesis, and place-and-route tools perform roles similar to compilers in the software domain. Yet, the complexity of advanced CMOS processes limits the direct application of open-source tools. Moreover, analog circuits require manual layout creation, which complicates reusability issues. To address this, our team has developed and continues to refine an automation tool for analog circuit layout design, aiming to surmount these hurdles. In summary, the trajectory of open-source hardware is promising, driven by community growth, IP sharing, and tool development. Our dedication to improving open-source hardware aims to democratize hardware design, echoing the revolutionary impact of open-source software.

Rob Mains, CHIPS Alliance, USA

 

Bio: Rob Mains is a 40-year industry veteran, former engineering vice president of Oracle and Sun Microsystems distinguished engineer. Prior to this, Rob was a principal engineer at Magma Design Automation, and originally a senior engineer at IBM. As general manager of CHIPS Alliance, a part of the Linux Foundation, Rob is working to build the open source hardware ecosystem to create a collaborative, worry-free environment for participants to work in and build innovative products off of open source components.

 

Position Statement: Open source hardware design, including both IP and EDA, will be an increasing ingredient in the development of any SoC. This will be necessitated by the continuing need for increased productivity of design teams, time to market, and reduced costs. Open source in hardware has the potential to provide this level of acceleration in hardware development to help keep pace with Moore’s law. There will be challenges in making this all a reality, but it is not an impossibility.

 

Tim ‘mithro’ Ansell, USA

 

Bio: Tim ‘mithro’ Ansell is a pioneering figure in open-source silicon, known for his crucial role in democratizing chip design. Through initiatives like the SkyWater and GlobalFoundries open-source PDKs and the Open MPW program, he has significantly lowered barriers to entry, enabling innovation and access for individuals and smaller entities in semiconductor technology.

 

Position Statement: Open-source Process Design Kits (PDKs) are pivotal not just for democratizing Integrated Circuit (IC) design but also for meeting the urgent need for training a growing workforce in a society that demands faster and more advanced IC development. The transparency inherent in open-source projects promotes a deeper understanding of semiconductor processes, fostering education and collaboration across geographical and institutional boundaries. By enabling broader participation in the design and fabrication process, open-source PDKs ensure that advancements in semiconductor technology can keep pace with societal needs. In essence, these initiatives are about building a future where technology development is inclusive, education is accessible, and the workforce is ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow’s IC demand.

Mohamed Kassam, Efabless, USA

Bio: Mohamed Kassam is the CTO and Co-Founder of efabless.com, the first semiconductor company applying open community innovation to all aspects of product development. Prior to launching efabless in 2014, Mohamed held several technical and global leadership positions within Texas Instruments’ Wireless Business Unit.

Mohamed joined TI in 2000 at the beginning of the digital telephony revolution fueled by the unprecedented integration of major phone functions on a single SoC. He led the first development of 45nm, 28nm analog & mixed-signal IP functions for wireless applications processors.

Mohamed holds a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

 

Position Statement: Open-source chip design tears down these barriers, empowering a global community of engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts to work together on cutting-edge solutions.

This collaborative approach accelerates the pace of innovation, driving down the cost of development and making powerful new chip technologies accessible to all.

By promoting transparency, reusability, and a shared knowledge base, open-source design reduces redundancy and streamlines development cycles. We envision a future where chip design is democratized, encouraging a new wave of creativity and problem-solving that benefits industries and individuals worldwide.

The open-source movement has the potential to revolutionize the semiconductor industry, fostering unprecedented collaboration and technological advancement.
